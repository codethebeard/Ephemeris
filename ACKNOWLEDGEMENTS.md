# Acknowledgements 

I want to sincerely thank and acknowledge the following sources for helping me understand the mechanics behind orbits and parsing TLE data

## Open Source Projects Used
- For better understanding rotation math and julian date conversion calculations: 
  - ZeiSatTrack [Apache 2.0] https://github.com/dhmspector/ZeitSatTrack

## Online Resources
Here are some of the online resources I used or read to get a better understanding of the mechanics behind tracking orbiting bodies.
